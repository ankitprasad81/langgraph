Previous Draft: Hello! I'm currently out of the office, but my emails are on a tropical island, sipping margaritas and waiting for your response. If you're feeling adventurous, you can try reaching out to my colleagues, who are probably back at the office, chained to their desks. Otherwise, I'll get back to you when I return, refreshed and ready to tackle the next project. Thanks for your patience!

Current Draft: Hello! I'm currently out of the office, but my emails are on a tropical island, sipping margaritas and waiting for your response. If you're feeling adventurous, you can try reaching out to my colleagues, who are probably back at the office, chained to their desks, fueled by an endless supply of coffee and regret. Alternatively, you can try bribing them with donuts, but let's be real, they're probably on a diet. In any case, I'll get back to you when I return, refreshed and ready to tackle the next project, or at the very least, I'll pretend to be productive for a few hours. Thanks for your patience, and please don't send any urgent emails, I'll just ignore them and hope you forget.
